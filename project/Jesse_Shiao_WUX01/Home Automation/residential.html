            <h4>SMART WIRING</h4>
            <p>Did you know that conventional wiring does not allow for computer networking or the ability to watch Apple TV,
                Sky or Blu-ray around your home? The fact is that these systems are not designed to manage modern communications.
                Smart wiring is a platform for Phone, Internet, TV and future systems to use around your house. Smart wiring
                also includes home automation systems for access around the house.</p>

            <h4>SAFETY & SECURITY</h4>
            <p>The incidence of burglaries while occupants are at home is increasing. At ACE Electronics our goal is to deter
                would-be intruders before they gain access and ensure a fast response to alarms. A safety and security system
                integrates intruder, life and fire protection in one simple, dependable package. ACE Electronics provides
                a complete suite of services for all your safety and security needs, including design, installation and maintenance.</p>

            <h4>HOME THEATRE</h4>
            <p>Many benefits of home theatre are obvious – all the fun of the cinema, whenever you feel like it, in your own
                home – but some are more subtle. Many of our clients are using home theatre as a way of providing their children
                with a safe place to interact with friends and learn. Whether it be for games, education or movies – Having
                the best theatre on the street means your house will probably be filled with your kids friends, but at least
                you know where they are. Our technicians undertake training and certification with internationally recognised
                organisations such as Dolby Labs and THX (Lucasfilm). We will setup and calibrate your home theatre for maximum
                performance, and enjoyment.</p>

            <h4>MULTIROOM AUDIO</h4>
            <p>A multi-room audio system allows you to listen to different music in different rooms and at different volumes,
                creating a great atmosphere throughout your home. With multi-room audio, you make use of one set of source
                equipment all around the house. Imagine listening to the news while you make dinner, background music in
                the lounge, or your favourite tunes around the BBQ with friends. Common sources include Spotify, Pandora,
                Sky, Radio, and Media servers like iTunes or Apple TV. Media servers and streamers are available with the
                capacity to store and playback every CD you ever owned. Many allow you to download and store music and movies
                from the web. Let our trained consultants help you pick the one that’s right for your family. Speaker choices
                are wider than ever before. Choose from options such as freestanding, in-wall, in-ceiling, soundbar invisible
                and outdoor speakers. We will help you select the perfect speaker for your environment.</p>

            <h4>LIGHTING & AUTOMATION</h4>
            <p>Our clients love the ability to create atmosphere with light and recall those presets as desired. They enjoy
                warm floors in the morning and automated lighting and fountains at dusk. Some of our clients simply appreciate
                the ability to conserve energy by automatically switching off equipment that is not in use. Imagine arriving
                home at night, you open the gate and garage doors with your app or remote control. Unsetting your alarm triggers
                a path of lights from the garage through the hall and down to the kitchen so you don’t have to fight with
                light switches all the way down the hall! Imagine hearing your rubbish bins being knocked over in the middle
                of the night, hitting the ‘panic’ button by the bed will flood the gardens with light. Imagine heading away
                on holiday for a few weeks – a ‘vacation’ button will shut all your lights off and turn off your underfloor
                heating, towel rails and hot water to conserve energy. We can even activate lights and blinds to give the
                appearance the house is occupied. Left the bathroom underfloor heating on by accident? – just log in with
                your phone app and shut it off. Have you ever seen a wall with three light switches, a thermostat, audio
                keypad, security keypad and 8″ LCD monitor for the gate camera? An automation system will replace this ‘wall
                acne’ with one stylish touch screen that can be programmed to control all these devices with ease. Ask your
                technology consultant what lighting and automation can do for you.</p>

            <h4>ACCESS CONTROL</h4>
            <p>Connected to an ACE Electronics smart wiring system, the intercom will call the phones in the house, negating
                the need for two or three centrally located handsets. You have the option of viewing the gate camera on any
                TV or mobile device, so you can keep an eye out for the pizza guy. Have you ever waited at home for a plumber?
                Our system enables you to call into the house while you’re away to unset the alarm and release the front
                door. Setting the alarm when they have finished is just as simple.</p>
