            The term “fracking” has come to mean far more than just the specific process of hydraulic fracturing,
            when companies inject large volumes of fracking fluid composed of water, sand and chemicals deep
            underground, at extreme pressure, to create fractures in targeted rock formations to bring oil and gas to
            the surface.

            Today, the term “fracking” represents the host of problems that this dangerous process entails. This report
            details evidence on the many reasons why fracking is unsafe and should be banned, including:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking water contamination destroys families’ drinking water.</b>
                Pollution from fracking chemicals contaminates drinking water and puts peoples’ health at risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking produces massive volumes of toxic and radioactive waste.</b>
                The disposal of this waste is causing earthquakes and putting drinking water resources at risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking pumps hazardous pollutants into the air.</b>
                Fracking uses over 100 dangerous chemicals known to cause life-threatening illnesses, including cancer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking destabilizes the climate.</b> Fracking wells release large amounts of methane gas, which
                is known to trap 87 times more heat than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the decades after it is
                emitted, contributing greatly to climate change.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking disrupts local communities.</b> Fracking presents a broad number of consequences for
                people living in areas where it is occurring, including damage to public roads, declines in property
                value, increased crime and an increased demand on emergency services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fracking causes thousands of accidents, leaks and spills.</b> More than 7,500 accidents related to
                fracking occurred in 2013, negatively impacting water quality in rivers, streams and shallow aquifers.
            </li>
