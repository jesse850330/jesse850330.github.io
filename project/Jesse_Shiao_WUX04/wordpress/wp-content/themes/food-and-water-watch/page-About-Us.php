            Our Mission
        </b>
        <p>
            Food & Water Watch champions healthy food and clean water for all.
            We stand up to corporations that put profits before people, and advocate for a
            democracy that improves people’s lives and protects our environment.
        </p>
        <b>
            Our Vision
        </b>
        <p>
            We are working to create a healthy future for our families and for generations to come—a world
            where all people have the resources they need, including wholesome food, clean water and sustainable
            energy. Making this happen requires organizing people from all over the country to build a large
            movement with the political power to make our democratic process work. Large numbers of people are
            a countervailing force to corporations “buying” public policy.
        </p>
        <b>
            Our Values
        </b>
        <p>
            <u>Independence</u><br> We are a public interest organization that remains independent of corporate
            and government influence. We are funded fully through our members, individual donors, and
            foundation grants.
            <br><br>
            <u>Democracy</u><br> We engage and mobilize citizens politically through person-to-person, on-the-ground
            organizing, educational campaigns and new media technologies. We believe political involvement is
            critical for holding governments accountable to their constituents and for creating policies that
            ensure a sustainable world with safe food and clean water.
            <br><br>
            <u>Human Rights</u><br> Although food and water are human rights, the political will to ensure that all
            people have adequate nutrition and drinking water is lacking. We are part of the growing global
            movement fighting this injustice.
            <br><br>
            <u>Sustainability</u><br> We believe in a sustainable future — one that ensures access to essential
            resources for future generations while protecting the quality of our environment.
        </p>
        <b>
            Our Staff
        </b>
        <p>
            In order to work closely with grassroots groups, our organizers are located in offices across the
            United States, and we have staff in Latin America and the European Union
            (where we are known as Food & Water Europe.)
            <br><br>
            We have experience developing winning political strategies, running successful on-the-ground campaigns,
            and speaking as experts to decision-makers and the media to meet our goals to protect people around the
            world from threats to our food and water.
