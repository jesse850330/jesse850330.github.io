                Oil and gas executives, journalists and environmentalists were stunned when Patrick Lee, a Vice
                President at one of the country’s largest utilities, admitted to a room full of industry leaders
                recently that the electrical grid can be powered completely by solar, wind and hydropower.
                <br><br>
                “I am speaking with confidence now. We have a solution now to adjust the intermittency of
                solar and wind energy that is no longer a technology challenge,” Lee, a VP at Sempra Energy,
                told a UC San Diego Institute of the Americas-sponsored energy conference. “So, installing a base
                load power plant is no longer your only option. You can now look at solar, wind and storage as
                alternatives, and still be able to manage the reliability of the grid.”
                <br><br>
                Lee plugged a subsidiary of Sempra, PXiSe Energy Solutions,  that is developing software to manage
                the electric grid from multiple sources, and cash in on falling prices of solar, wind and battery
                storage.
                <br><br>
                “How fast do you want to get to 100 percent? That can be done today,” he told the audience.
